                <h1>Why Write</h1>
                <p>Latino representation in big tech is a topic close to my heart. 
                    Through this project, I aim to provide a platform that combines research, personal stories, 
                    and resources to highlight challenges and opportunities for Latinos in the industry. 
                    By shedding light on these systemic barriers and celebrating successes, 
                    I want to inspire change and empower individuals to overcome these challenges. 
                    This initiative serves as both an informative tool and a call to action to bridge the gap in representation 
                    and foster a more inclusive tech community.

                    <h4>Highlighting Latino Representation in Tech</h4>
                    <p>As a computer science major, I wanted to create a project that demonstrates my ability to code while reflecting my personal interests. 
                        My website focuses on building tools that matter to me and align with my passion for increasing Latino representation in big tech. 
                        By developing this project, I aim to inspire students like me and provide a resource for research, 
                        all while crafting a fun and engaging user interface to captivate young audiences. 
                        This genre allows me to merge technical skills with a purpose-driven mission.

                    <h4>A Platform for Inspiration</h4>
                    <p>I chose this project to inspire other students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, 
                        to see coding as an accessible and impactful skill. By creating a space that connects with their experiences, 
                        I hope to show that representation matters and that they too can pursue careers in tech. 
                        My goal is to lead by example and foster a sense of possibility for others.<br><br><br></p>

                    <h4>Engaging and Interactive Design</h4>
                    <p>To maintain the focus of young users, the website is designed with a vibrant and engaging user interface. Every detail, 
                        from color schemes to interactive elements, has been carefully crafted to create an enjoyable experience. 
                        A fun UI not only attracts attention but also helps in making complex topics more accessible and less intimidating. 
                        This is going to be seen with updates to the website. I have plans for other tabs that are connected. 
                        However, right now my technical skills still need work. <br></p>
